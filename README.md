# 📚 ChainShelf — Transparent Blockchain Book Records

ChainShelf is a **Solidity-based smart contract** designed to make **book checkouts and returns fully transparent** on the blockchain.  
It allows libraries, institutions, or communities to maintain **tamper-proof book lending records**, ensuring fairness, accountability, and trust.

## 🚀 Project Description

In traditional library systems, book borrow and return records are stored in centralized databases — which can be altered, lost, or corrupted.  
**ChainShelf** uses blockchain technology to create a **decentralized record-keeping system** where every book checkout and return is logged permanently and transparently.

This project is built for **Solidity beginners** who want to understand:
- Smart contract logic  
- Access control (owner vs. users)  
- Event logging for transparency  
- Real-world blockchain applications  

---

## 💡 What It Does

- 📘 The **library owner** can add books to the blockchain.  
- 🙋‍♂️ Any user can **check out** or **return** a book.  
- 🔍 Everyone can **view book status** — checked out or available.  
- ⛓️ All actions are **recorded immutably** on-chain for full transparency.
