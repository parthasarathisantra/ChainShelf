## ðŸš€ Project Description

Traditional library systems rely on centralized databases to track book borrowings and returns â€” which can be manipulated or lost.  
**ChainShelf** solves this by recording every checkout and return **permanently on the blockchain**, ensuring **trust, visibility, and accountability**.

This project is perfect for beginners learning **Solidity**, **Remix IDE**, and the basics of **decentralized applications (DApps)**.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

- Lets the **library owner** add books to the system.  
- Allows **users** to check out and return books using their Ethereum addresses.  
- Logs every event (add, checkout, return) **transparently on-chain**.  
- Anyone can view book records publicly â€” no hidden data, no central authority.
